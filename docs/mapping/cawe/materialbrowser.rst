The Material Browser
====================

|Buttons for opening the Material Browser.| One of the most important
dialogs when working with CaWE is the *Material Browser*. Materials are
used by many tools, e.g. when new brushes, bezier patches or terrains
are created or when the surface properties of such an element are
edited. The Material Browser displays all available materials as
thumbnails and allows you to select one for subsequent operations with
the tools.

The image to the right shows the essential buttons for opening the
Material Browser. In most cases and with most tools, you'll use the
default button in the left Material Toolbar for opening the Material
Browser, but the “Edit Face Properties” tool has an own dialog that has
its own button.

Please note that when you press the ``Browse`` button *for the first
time during a CaWE session*, CaWE has to cache-in the available
materials all at once. Therefore it may take a short while until all
materials are loaded. This will only happen once during a CaWE session,
and pressing the ``Browse`` button another time will open the Material
Browser instantly.

| The most essential details of the Material Browser dialog are
  presented in the image below.
