Your First Map
==============

The flash tutorial below introduces you to the basic features and
concepts of CaWE and demonstrates how you can create your first map. It
starts with opening a new map file in the Cafu World Editor CaWE, then
walks you step-by-step through the construction process. At the end, the
map is compiled and run in the Cafu engine.

The tutorial assumes that you have already installed CaWE and completed
the initial one-time configuration as described in section
:ref:`Installation, Initial Configuration and De-Installation <installation_initial_configuration_and_de-installation>`.

Although the tutorial does not require any previous knowledge, it is
helpful to read the preceding “Getting started” chapters either before
starting or while working through the tutorial.
