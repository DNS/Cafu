====== Your First Map ======

The flash tutorial below introduces you to the basic features and concepts of CaWE and demonstrates how you can create your first map. It starts with opening a new map file in the Cafu World Editor CaWE, then walks you step-by-step through the construction process. At the end, the map is compiled and run in the Cafu engine.

The tutorial assumes that you have already installed CaWE and completed the initial one-time configuration as described in section [[mapping:cawe:install]].

Although the tutorial does not require any previous knowledge, it is helpful to read the preceding "Getting started" chapters either before starting or while working through the tutorial.
