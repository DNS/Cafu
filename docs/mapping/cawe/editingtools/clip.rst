The Clipping Tool
=================

|image0|

The clipping tool allows you to cut brushes into 2 pieces along a
defined clipping plane. You can keep either one of the pieces or both
after cutting them.

Although you could use
:ref:`The Edit Vertices (Morph) Tool <the_edit_vertices_morph_tool>` to
shape a brush, it is sometimes easier to cut off pieces from a larger
brush to get the fitting result.

To activate the Clipping tool, click on the related icon in the tool bar
or use ``SHIFT``\ +\ ``X``.

Using the Clipping tool
-----------------------

|image1|

First you need to have an object already selected by
:ref:`The Selection Tool <the_selection_tool>`.

| 

|image2|

Now you can drag a line between to points in a 2D view to define a
clipping plane. The cyan colored line is your clipping plane and shows
where the brush is cut. Thick white lines show the parts of the brush
that will be kept after the cut. If the whole brush is painted in white
lines, the brush will be cut, but both pieces will be kept.

Note that you can't temporarily deactivate the grid snap setting by
pressing ``ALT`` here, so you have to deactivate it permanently by
pressing ``SHIFT``\ +\ ``W`` if you want to make finer cuts. You can
activate it again by pressing ``SHIFT``\ +\ ``W`` after your finished.

To do the cut you have to press ``ENTER`` and only the chosen pieces
remain.
