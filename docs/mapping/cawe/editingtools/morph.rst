The Edit Vertices (Morph) Tool
==============================

|image0| The ‚ÄúEdit Vertices‚Äù tool (also called the ‚ÄúMorph‚Äù tool) allows
you to edit the individual vertices of a brush and the control vertices
of a bezier patch. (Please refer to
:ref:`The New Brush Tool <the_new_brush_tool>` and
:ref:`The New Bezier Patch Tool <the_new_bezier_patch_tool>` in order to
learn more about how brushes and bezier patches are created.)

The vertices are the corner points of brushes. Being able to spatially
manipulate them indiviually allows you to shape brushes in arbitrary
ways that are difficult if not impossible to achieve with the other
tools. Also the shape of bezier patches is controlled by special
vertices that are called the *control vertices* of the patch. Modifying
these control vertices indirectly modifies the shape of the bezier
patch, so that they can be brought into every possible form.

Overview
--------

| Here is an overview of how the Edit Vertices tool is used:
| (Click each of the images below to see them in their larger, natural
  size.)

#. |image1| Select the object (brush or bezier patch) whose vertices you
   want to edit with the :ref:`Selection tool <the_selection_tool>`
   first. You can also select multiple objects for vertex editing at the
   same time, but it's not recommended.
#. |image2| Activate the Edit Vertices (Morph) tool by clicking on the
   related button on the Tools toolbar or by pressing the ``SHIFT+V``
   shortcut key.
#. |image3| Use the mouse to select or drag the vertex or edge handles.
   The vertex handles are shown as white squares, the edge handles as
   yellow squares. When you left-click to select individual handles,
   note that you can use the ``CTRL`` key in order to ‚Äútoggle‚Äù the
   selection. (This works very much as with files in the Windows
   Explorer.) Selection and dragging works both in the 2D as well as the
   3D views.
#. |image4| When done, just leave the Morph tool e.g. by switching back
   to the :ref:`Selection tool <the_selection_tool>`. CaWE will then
   render the resulting brush as usual.

The Convex-Hull Principle
-------------------------

For the purpose of editing brushes, the CaWE Edit Vertices tool is
implemented according to the ‚Äúconvex-hull principle‚Äù. Roughly said, a
convex-hull is the smallest space that contains a set of vertices. For a
more thorough but mathematical definition please see the Wikipedia
article `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull>`__.

However, most CaWE users are already familiar with convex-hulls from
another aspect of mapping, because they occur in a broader context:
brushes! Each and every (valid) brush that you create with the
:ref:`New Brush tool <the_new_brush_tool>` is a convex hull of its
vertices, and it stays that way no matter how you scale, rotate, shear,
clip or morph it later.

Therefore, the morph tool operates by switching back and forth between
the normal representation of a brush as you are used to, and it's convex
hull representation. When you activate the Morph tool, the selected
brush is first converted into its convex hull representation. Then, when
you drag its vertices, you are actually dragging the vertices of the
convex hull, and when you're done, the convex hull is just converted
back into the normal brush representation. This works so well because
brushes are per definition just another representation of the vertices
of a convex hull ‚Äì switching back and forth is mathematically a
straightforward operation.

As a consequence, while it is impossible to use any of the other CaWE
tools to turn a valid brush into an ‚Äúinvalid‚Äù brush (whatever that is),
this statement also holds for the CaWE Morph tool! That is, it is quasi
*impossible* to turn a valid brush into an invalid brush by dragging a
vertex or edge handle\ `1) <#fn__1>`__. This property makes CaWE
different from map editors of other engines (e.g. the Valve Hammer
Editor 4.0), where it is *really easy* to accidentally turn a valid into
an invalid brush (which means lost work) with the Morph tool.

In summary, the convex-hull principle that is implemented in the CaWE
Morph tool is a very powerful concept that makes vertex editing very
simple and intuitive, and at the same time *guarantees* that you cannot
accidentally make an invalid brush. Just try the CaWE Morph tool out for
a while ‚Äì and you won't go back to other map editors! üòâ

The Tool Options Bar
--------------------

|image5| When you activate the tool, the tool options bar shows controls
that are specific to the Morph tool:

At the ``Edit`` radio buttons you can choose whether you would like to
edit only the vertices (represented by white handles), only the edges
(yellow handles), or both. Usually it's the easiest to leave the setting
at both, but if you have a preference you can set it here. Note that
only brushes have edges, the concept does not apply to bezier patches.

The ``Insert Vertices`` button inserts a new vertex into the center of a
selected brush. It does only work if you have exactly one brush
selected. That is, if you have instead a bezier patch patch selected or
more than one brush or even a mix of multiple objects, it will just do
nothing except for presenting you a message box that explains the
exactly-one-brush requirement.

The inserted vertex will initially be located in the center of the
brush. Thus, according to the convex-hull principle, it will be ‚Äúloose‚Äù
and initially *not* affect the shape of the brush. However, when you
start to drag this vertex so that it becomes relevant for the convex
hull, CaWE will automatically create the new shape of the brush
according to the convex-hull principle.

The next section has a series of images that demonstrate how you use the
``Insert Vertices`` button at the example of a cube that gets two
vertices added to form a more complex brush.

Face Splitting and Removal
--------------------------

| Adding new faces to or removing existing faces from brushes naturally
  follows from the convex-hull principle. Please refer to the following
  image series in order to learn how new faces are added to a simple
  brush by first clicking the ``Insert Vertex`` button and then dragging
  the newly inserted vertex. In the second and fifth image, the new
  vertices that were inserted by a click on the ``Insert Vertex`` button
  have been selected (red squares) for better visual accentuation. The
  respectively next images (the third and sixth) show the result of
  these vertices being dragged into new positions.
| (Click each of the images to see them in their larger, natural size.)

|image6| |image7| |image8| |image9| |image10| |image11| |image12|

Faces are removed again my dragging one or more of their related
vertices back ‚Äúinto‚Äù (somewhere near the center) of the brush or just
onto other vertices. According to the convex hull principle, they then
cannot contribute to the convex hull and thus the brush any more ‚Äì the
face has been removed. (Just read the above image sequence in reverse to
see how this works.)

Note that for brushes, the Morph tool automatically eliminates duplicate
vertices. That is, if you drag one vertex exactly onto another so that
you cannot tell them apart any more, CaWE will just remove the duplicate
vertex. This is also why pressing the ``Insert Vertices`` button does
apparently nothing when it is pressed several times in a row: It just
creates vertices all in the same place (the exact center of the brush),
which are immediately collected again because they are duplicates of
each other.

For bezier patches, being able to have multiple individual vertices all
in the same place is sometimes a crucial feature, so the removal of
duplicates does not apply.

Shaping Bezier Patches
----------------------

When you use the Morph tool to edit the control vertices of bezier
patches, the concepts of edges, convex hulls, vertex insertions and
duplicate removals do not apply, but otherwise the tool behaves
naturally and analogously to editing the corner vertices of brushes.

Selecting vertices individually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With bezier patches, it frequently occurs that multiple vertices are in
the exact same position, overlaying each other. This is often
intentionally and required to achieve certain spatial shapes. When you
click on such vertices in the 2D views, they all get selected at the
same time. This is usually what is wanted, but if instead you want to
selected the vertices separately, just clear the selection and then
click on the vertex in the *3D view*. Contrary to the 2D views,
selecting vertices in the 3D view only ever selects *one vertex at a
time*. Although the situation looks visually the same as before in the
2D views, you can now use the mouse to drag the single vertex in the 2D
or 3D views without affecting the others in the same place.

         To be honest, there *is* a way to create invalid brushes with
         the CaWE Morph tool, namely when you create a zero-volume brush
         by dragging too many vertices ‚Äúonto‚Äù each other (into the same
         spatial position). CaWE will then reconstruct the original
         brush when you try to exit the Morph tool in that situation.
