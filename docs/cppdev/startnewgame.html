After you took <a href="/cppdev:gettingstarted#getting_started_with_the_cafu_source_code" class="wikilink1" title="cppdev:gettingstarted">the first steps with the Cafu source code</a>, you&#039;re ready to use it to develop your own game or application.
</p>

<p>
This section lists the most commonly used methods for starting new projects and explains the required steps to give you a good start.

<h2 class="sectionedit2">Cloning DeathMatch</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The “normal” and recommended way to start a new game is to create a copy of the example game DeathMatch under a different name. This is useful because it immediately provides you with the proper directory structure, working code, and example files.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cloning DeathMatch&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;cloning_deathmatch&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:0,&quot;secid&quot;:2,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;324-605&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit3">Creating the clone</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Creating the copy is straightforward:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In <code>Games</code>, duplicate the directory <code>DeathMatch</code> and name the resulting copy as desired, e.g. <code>MyGame</code>.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Delete the directory <code>build</code> in <code>Games/MyGame/Code</code>.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second step is necessary because previous builds of DeathMatch may have created files whose copy can confuse the linker when it is creating the program library for <code>MyGame</code> for the first time.
</p>

<p>
To implement these steps, you can use any method you like, for example a file manager like Windows Explorer, or the command-line. This example shows how you can do it under Linux:
</p>
<pre class="code bash">$ <span class="kw2">cp</span> <span class="re5">-r</span> Games<span class="sy0">/</span>DeathMatch<span class="sy0">/</span> Games<span class="sy0">/</span>MyGame<span class="sy0">/</span>
$ <span class="kw2">rm</span> <span class="re5">-rf</span> Games<span class="sy0">/</span>MyGame<span class="sy0">/</span>Code<span class="sy0">/</span>build</pre>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit4">Using your new game</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Technically, the above steps are all that is required to create the basis for your new game:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When you re-run SCons as documented at <a href="/cppdev:gettingstarted#getting_started_with_the_cafu_source_code" class="wikilink1" title="cppdev:gettingstarted">Getting Started with the Cafu Source Code</a>, the code of your new game will automatically be picked up, compiled and linked.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When you start <abbr title="Cafu World Editor">CaWE</abbr>, it will automatically recognize the new game and show it in the “Configure”, “New Map”, “New <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>”, … etc. dialogs.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you run the Cafu Engine from the command prompt, make sure to add parameter <pre class="code">-svGame MyGame</pre>

<p>
to the command-line (see below how to get rid of it again).

<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you want to run your game by default (without <code>-svGame</code>), see the section about the variable <code>GameLibs</code> in file <code>CompilerSetup.py</code>:<pre class="code python"><span class="co1"># When you're developing your own game, you might want to keep game DeathMatch</span>
<span class="co1"># for reference. Cafu should run your game by default (first in list), whereas</span>

 Note that you have to re-run SCons in order for changes to take effect.

Here is a list of alternative courses of action that you may want to consider in order to start a new game:

<h3 class="sectionedit7">Modifying DeathMatch</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Working directly with the DeathMatch game “in situ” may seem like a totally silly  idea to you, but in some cases it can be a worthwhile consideration nevertheless:
</p>

<p>
If you want to quickly try something out (e.g. a new entity class), or if you work on something that is not directly or entirely a completely new game (for example, any changes to the core engine), the game DeathMatch might be a welcome testbed.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you wish to communicate and collaborate with people who are not directly involved with your game code, the DeathMatch code can be a good common ground.
</p>

<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Modifying DeathMatch&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;modifying_deathmatch&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:3,&quot;secid&quot;:7,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;3112-3745&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit8">Renaming DeathMatch</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Renaming DeathMatch, instead of properly copying it, would principally work, if it was not for these factors:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> It does not agree well with version control systems (Git or Subversion). If you follow our recommendation to checkout the Cafu source code from our Git or Subversion repository, so that you can keep track of our latest developments while developing your own game in parallel, then renaming the DeathMatch directory is (indeed not impossible, but) somewhat incompatible with the way how these repositories work.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Some file paths in code and scripts still point to <code>Games/DeathMatch/…</code>. If you rename DeathMatch, all these paths are broken, and your game will not work without fixing them first. If you instead copy DeathMatch, your game will find some of its resources in game DeathMatch, and you can update these occurrences step by step at any later time (or even intentionally keep things like this).</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall, we recommend <em>not</em> to rename DeathMatch. Better clone it as explained above.
</p>

<h3 class="sectionedit9">Starting from scratch</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Creating a new, empty directory in <code>Games/</code> in order to start from scratch, then fill it with contents as required, is certainly possible.
</p>

<p>
Doing this can be a very good choice if your main goal is to learn and understand the technical details from the ground up, or if you only want to have original content in your game right from the start.
</p>

<p>
In fact, we&#039;re considering complementing the DeathMatch example game with another “Minimal” example game that comes closer to these goals.
</p>

<p>
If you start with an empty directory,
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> your progress will be slower,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> despite the support forums are always available, you should be technically versed enough to cope with most problems and errors,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> be prepared to copy pieces of DeathMatch example code anyway.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sectionedit10">Using VSWM</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The VSWM <abbr title="MODification, a self-contained game for the Cafu Engine">MOD</abbr> is old, obsolete, dysfunctional, and a candidate for removal.
Not a good basis for a new game. Don&#039;t use it.
