====== Skins ======

Skins are used to apply alternative sets of materials to a model.

Typical examples are the butterfly model, where a single mesh is used with multiple skins to implement several species of butterflies; or a monster that exists in tame, mean and hellborn variants.

Skins are defined and edited in the Model Editor as described below.
The //use// of skins is up to the game's script or C++ code.


===== The skins list =====

{{ :modeleditor:skins-list.png?|}}
The **Skins** pane lists all skins in the model.

For each skin,
  * its name and
  * the skin number
is shown.

A single click on a skin selects it, a double click opens the **Skin Inspector** pane as well.

Pressing the **F2** key or a single-click on an already selected skin allows you to rename the skin in place.

The “**+**” button creates a new skin and adds it to the list.
The “**-**” button deletes the currently selected skins.

==== Context menu ====

An RMB click in the **Skins** pane opens the context menu:
  * **Rename** allows to rename the skin.
  * **Add/create new**, like the "**+**" button, creates a new skin and adds it to the list.

===== The skin inspector =====

{{ :modeleditor:skin-inspector.png?|}}
Skins don't have explicit properties of their own, thus the **Skin Inspector** pane is just a help dialog that explains the situation:

To use a skin, select it in the **Skins** list (shown above), then use the [[:modeleditor:meshes|Mesh Inspector]] to assign a material to the mesh in the selected skin.
