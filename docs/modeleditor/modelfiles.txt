====== Model Files Explained ======

Each model comprises several files on disk, such as the model file, material definition files, and texture images.

When you save a model in the Model Editor, the editor creates or re-creates some of these files, updates others, and leaves alone the rest.
The result is normally exactly what you want and expect, but sometimes you may wish to hand-tune some details (such as the material definitions) without and independently of the Model Editor. In such cases, it is very helpful to understand the files that belong to a model.

This section explains the files that together form a model and how they relate to each other.


===== One directory per model =====

Although not a technical requirement and not enforced by the Cafu model code, it is highly recommended to save each model in a directory of its own. This

  * explicitly groups all files that logically form and belong to the model, and
  * makes packaging a complete model in a ''my_model.zip'' archive possible, so that the model can easily and safely be distributed, shipped and handled.

The name of the directory should match the file name of the model. That is, if your model's name is ''Trinity.cmdl'', it should be stored in a directory with the same name ''Trinity/'' (or in a zip archive with the same base name ''Trinity.zip'').

Note that when you are saving a new model that does not yet have a separate directory, you can use the "New Folder" button (or right-click context menu) of the "Save" dialog to create such new directories as required.

Example:
<code dos>
d:\Dev\Cafu\Games\DeathMatch\Models\Players> dir Trinity
ChromeBuckle_diff.png
ChromeGlass_diff.png
Pants_diff.png
Skin_diff.png
Trinity.cmat
Trinity.cmdl
Trinity.cmdl_bak
Trinity_editor.cmat
</code>


===== cmdl model files =====

The ''cmdl'' file is the main file of the model: It contains the definitions for the skeleton, the meshes and the animation sequences of the model.

The Cafu Engine and the Model Editor load ''cmdl'' files as [[http://www.lua.org/|Lua]] scripts, and as such they can be inspected or edited in a text editor if desired.

Besides the main ''cmdl'' file, the Model Editor also creates a ''cmdl_bak'' backup file that contains the contents of the ''cmdl'' file before it was last saved. (If you ship your model as a ''zip'' archive, the ''cmdl_bak'' file is typically redundant and can be omitted from the archive for space efficiency.)

Example:
<code dos>
d:\Dev\Cafu\Games\DeathMatch\Models\Players> dir Trinity\*.cmdl*
Trinity.cmdl
Trinity.cmdl_bak
</code>


===== cmat material definition files =====

The ''cmat'' files contain the material definitions for the meshes of this model.

The main ''cmat'' file must have the same base name as the model ("Trinity"), so that the full name is for example ''Trinity.cmat''. This file is for your hand-written material script code, if any, and is never touched or overwritten by the Model Editor (with one exception, see below).

The Model Editor also writes a secondary ''cmat'' file whose name ends with ''_editor.cmat''. This file is written anew each time the model is saved, and contains material definitions whose script code was not hand-crafted, but who were created or edited in the Model Editor.

Example:
<code dos>
d:\Dev\Cafu\Games\DeathMatch\Models\Players> dir Trinity\*.cmat
Trinity.cmat
Trinity_editor.cmat
</code>

The two ''cmat'' files are linked as follows:
When the Cafu model code loads the materials of a model, it opens the main ''cmat'' file (''Trinity.cmat''). This file contains a statement like
<code lua>
dofile("Trinity_editor.cmat");
</code>
in order to include and process the secondary ''_editor.cmat'' along with the main file.

The only exception when the Model Editor touches the main ''Trinity.cmat'' file is when the file does not yet exist, or doesn't contain the ''dofile()'' reference to the editor file. In this case, the ''_editor.cmat'' would not be loaded at all, and thus the Model Editor inserts the ''dofile()'' line into the main ''cmat'' file.

In summary, the goal of keeping two separate ''cmat'' files that are linked as described above is to keep your hand-crafted material script code and the Model Editor edited material definitions cleanly separated, without any danger of one overwriting the other.


===== Texture images =====

The texture images are referenced from the material definition scripts.
