Additionally, the Model Editor had to re-read the new material definitions anyway, so even if our edits were made in the right file, we had to close and reopen the model.</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="scale_my_model">... scale my model?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
There are two main methods for scaling a model:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> via the Skeleton / the Joint Inspector</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> via the Transform dialog</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <a href="/modeleditor:skeleton" class="wikilink1" title="modeleditor:skeleton">Joint Inspector</a> can transform individual joints of the model, but only for the <em>bind pose</em>. It is mostly useful for static, non-animated models, but even then only if there is a special requirement that the Transform dialog cannot handle.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/modeleditor:transform" class="wikilink1" title="modeleditor:transform">Transform dialog</a> is much easier to use, as it transforms the entire model (the whole skeleton): the transformation is applied to all currently selected animation sequences. If no animation sequence is selected at all, the “bind pose” is transformed.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;... scale my model?&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;scale_my_model&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:0,&quot;secid&quot;:4,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;1924-2633&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="import_animations_from_other_models">... import animations from other models?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In some cases, importing animations is very easy: Use the “<strong>+</strong>” button in the <a href="/modeleditor:animations" class="wikilink1" title="modeleditor:animations">Animations</a> pane as demonstrated in the above video.
</p>

<p>
However, this works only if the animations are stored in separate files that are compatible with the already loaded mesh. This is specifically the case with <code>md5anim</code>s for their related <code>md5mesh</code> file.
</p>

<p>
We will extend this functionality in the future. Until then and for all other cases, see the next How-To about generically sharing and re-using elements.
</p>

<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;... import animations from other models?&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;import_animations_from_other_models&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:0,&quot;secid&quot;:5,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;2634-3197&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="share_and_re-use_animations_skins_etc_from_other_models">... share and re-use animations, skins etc. from other models?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Creating variants of a model by sharing or re-using elements of another model is a straightforward idea, but generally not easy to implement: For example, it&#039;s easy to share meshes and animations when the skeleton is an exact match, but much harder to do otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to manually edit the <code>cmdl</code> model file, which is a Lua script as documented at <a href="/modeleditor:modelfiles" class="wikilink1" title="modeleditor:modelfiles">Model Files Explained</a>.
</p>

<p>
For example, copying and pasting the definition of an animation from one player model into another (that has a compatible, matching skeleton), tends to work very well.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to use Lua&#039;s <code>dofile()</code> statement to include models into each other, which we intent to augment in the future to load globals from one model file into a table of another, as to keep the global namespace of the current model clean.
All variants of such file inclusion however suffer the problem that it creates a dependency of one file on another. This may be exactly what you want, or maybe not – where in the latter case falling back to copy and paste is probably the better solution.
