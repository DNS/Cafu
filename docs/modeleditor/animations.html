<p>
For many models, animations are the most noticeable and most important feature:
Animation sequences define how a model moves, behaves or transforms over a period of time.
</p>

<p>
Animation sequences, like the model itself, are typically created by the model artist before the model is imported into the Model Editor.
</p>

The <strong>Animations</strong> pane lists all animation sequences in the model.
</p>

<p>
For each animation sequence,
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> its name and</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the sequence number</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
is shown.
</p>

<p>
A single click on an animation sequence selects it, a double click opens the <strong>Animation Inspector</strong> pane as well.
</p>

<p>
Pressing the <strong>F2</strong> key or a single-click on an already selected animation sequence allows you to rename the sequence in place.
</p>

<p>
The “<strong>+</strong>” button imports a new animation sequence (e.g. from a <code>.md5anim</code> file) and adds it to the list.
The “<strong>-</strong>” button deletes the currently selected animation sequences.

The speed in frames-per-second with which this animation sequence is played.

<h3 class="sectionedit8">Next sequence</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
This is the number of the animation sequence to play after the current sequence.
</p>

<p>
This value is set to -1 to indicate “no” next sequence, which is used for animations that should just stop when they&#039;ve reached their last frame. For example, a sequence of a player model for dropping to the ground after it was mortally wounded typically has a next sequence value of -1, indicating that this is a “non-looping” sequence.
</p>

<p>
Setting the value to the same number as the number of this sequence means “play this sequence again when its end has been reached”. It&#039;s another way of saying that this is a looping sequence, such as walking or running.
</p>

<p>
Setting the value to a number other than -1 (“non-looping”) or the own sequence number (“looping”) can be useful to indicate logically consecutive sequences. For example, if a player model has a sequence for holstering its weapon, the “next sequence” value might be the number of an idle sequence – whatever the player does after he has the hands free.
</p>

<p>
In summary, note that the “next sequence” setting is mostly used to indicate looping vs. non-looping sequences, and that often the game script or C++ code will override whatever has been entered here: The model artists and the game programmers will have to communicate regarding the exact purpose of the animation sequences in order to make best use of this feature.
