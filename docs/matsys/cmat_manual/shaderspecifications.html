<div class="level1">

<p>
The examples of material definitions that we have seen so far were only composed of texture map specifications. In the <a href="/matsys:introduction" class="wikilink1" title="matsys:introduction">MatSys Introduction</a> we have learned that internally, “shaders” take materials to finally implement how they are rendered and how they look. In cases like our example materials above, the <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr> selects shaders from a built-in library automatically, picking the one that best fits the material.
</p>

<p>
But what if you want to change the way how your materials are rendered, either just in the details or radically from ground up? What if you don&#039;t want regular Phong lighting? Or you want an entirely different method to render diffuse-maps or a different way to combine them with normal-maps? What if the built-in shaders don&#039;t cover a way of rendering that you prefer? It also happens that the built-in shaders do not take cube-maps into account at all, so what if you want to have a material with cube-map environment reflections?
</p>

<p>
The answer to these questions is two-fold: You have to override the automatic shader selection by assigning a shader manually. But you also have to “know” that shader: You have to know its name, or you cannot assign it to your material. You have to know wether it needs a diffuse-map or a cube-map or both, or any other combination of texture map images, so that you can specify them in your material definition. Sometimes you have to know even more details about it.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr> renderers have more shaders built-in than just those that are considered during the automatical selection. They are documented below, inclusive sample material definitions, and you can use them to override the auto-selection. Alternatively, if you know or are a programmer, you can also make your own shaders. By making own shaders you gain the greatest flexibility that you can get, because only shaders eventually define how materials look, and shaders can do everything that the underlying hardware can do!
</p>

<p>
There is another issue that you should know about shaders: Each material gets not only one shader assigned, but <em>two</em>. This is because the Cafu Material System renders materials in two steps: First, the <em>ambient</em> part of a material is rendered, that is, everything that is rendered even if no light source is present. The <em>ambient shader</em> of a material is responsible for how this part is rendered. Then, the parts of the material looks that are contributed by each light source are rendered separately, as for example diffuse reflections, specular highlights and other effetcs. The per-light-source contributions are controlled by the <em>light shader</em> of a material.
</p>

<p>
You set the ambient and light shader of a material (and thereby override the automatic selection) with the following keywords in the material definitions body:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong><code>AmbientShader MyAmbientShader</code></strong> assigns the shader with name <code>MyAmbientShader</code> as the ambient shader to this material.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong><code>LightShader MyLightShader</code></strong> assigns the shader with name <code>MyLightShader</code> as the per-light-source shader to this material.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is an example for how these statements could be used in a material definition:
</p>
<pre class="code">    Textures/Kai/barrel_rst
    {
        AmbientShader myCarMetallicBlue_ambient
        LightShader   myCarMetallicBlue_light

        diffusemap    Textures/Kai/barrel_rst_diff.png
        normalmap     flipNMyAxis(Textures/Kai/barrel_rst_norm.png)
        cubeMap       Textures/SkyDomes/ReflectiveCubeMap#.jpg
    }</pre>

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="built-in_special-purpose_shaders">Built-in special-purpose Shaders</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Currently, all <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr> renderers come with several special-purpose shaders built-in (special-purpose means that they are never taken into account for automatic assignment). In most cases, they are actually pairs of shaders, one shader for the ambient and one shader for the per-light contribution of the same effect, but you will find that the exception to this rule is more often true than not.
More built-in shaders are currently in preparation, for example for special effects like cube-map environment reflections, realistic water surfaces, etc. Note that any programmer can also write his own shaders, allowing him to implement <em>any</em> rendering effect that he wants! This makes the <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr> highly flexible, extensible and future-proof, and was one of its primary design goals.
</p>

<p>
The following special-purpose shaders are currently built into all renderers of the <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr>. Please note these shaders and their related examples are pretty advanced, and you might want to skip them until later. It may be convenient to first finish reading the rest of this documentation, which will help to fully understand the special-purpose shader examples.

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="the_skydome_shader">The SkyDome Shader</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In order to create surfaces that are invisible like fully transparent glass and instead only show the far sky dome beyond them, the ambient shader <strong><code>A_SkyDome</code></strong> exists. It basically only requires a cube-map for the sky to be specified. In fact, it ignores the specification of any other (i.e. diffuse-, normal-, etc.) maps. However, in most cases you&#039;ll want to specify additional keywords that further describe the properties of the sky surfaces. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre class="code">    Textures/SkyDomes/PK_BrightDay2
    {
        // Activate the A_SkyDome shader as the ambient shader
        AmbientShader A_SkyDome

        // Have no dynamic light affect surfaces with this material.
        LightShader   none
        noDynLight

        // The &#039;#&#039; in the next line is auto-replaced with the relevant suffixes (_px, _ny, ...).
        cubeMap Textures/SkyDomes/PK_BrightDay2#.png, wrapS clampToEdge, wrapT clampToEdge


        // Don&#039;t write into the z-Buffer, so that entities (like missiles) outside of the map can still be drawn.
        ambientMask d

        // This material does not cast dynamic shadows.
        noShadows

        // Don&#039;t create or keep lightmaps for this material, don&#039;t participate in Radiosity computations.
        meta_noLightMap

        // This keyword states that this material casts sunlight.
        meta_sunlight
            // The irradiance of the sunlight in Watt/m^2 that comes (or shines) through this material.
            // Values like (100  90  80) might work, too.
            (220  180  100)
            // The direction of the incoming sunlight rays. The z-component should be negative.
            // (These values match the actual position of the sun in the cube-maps.)
            (-17 -699 -715)
    }</pre>

<p>
The <strong><code>AmbientShader A_SkyDome</code></strong> line activates the ambient sky dome shader. Note that the far away sky dome is <em>not</em> affected by light of any dynamic light source, and therefore we assign the <strong><code>none</code></strong> shader as the per-lightsource shader in order to make sure that no dynamic light is applied to sky surfaces. The <strong><code>noDynLight</code></strong> keyword does essentially the same as <strong><code>LightShader none</code></strong> and will soon be obsoleted. Until then, please use it together with each occurrence of <strong><code>LightShader none</code></strong>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong><code>cubeMap …</code></strong> statement specifies the cube-map that is to be used for this sky. If you also specified other texture maps like diffuse-maps or specular-maps, they would simply be ignored, as the <strong><code>A_SkyDome</code></strong> shader has no use for them.
</p>

<p>
The remaining keywords further specify important properties of this material. Please refer to section <a href="/matsys:cmat_manual:keywordreference" class="wikilink1" title="matsys:cmat_manual:keywordreference">Keyword Reference</a> for a detailed description. Short explanations of their meanings are given in the comments in the above example.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="the_terrain_shader">The Terrain Shader</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The terrain shader exists in order to render the Cafu outdoor terrains, which work a bit different than regular, Phong-lit surfaces. You activate the ambient terrain shader by writing
</p>
<pre class="code">    AmbientShader A_Terrain</pre>

<p>
in the materials body. Normally, you would now to expect to also assign a terrain-specific shader for the per-lightsource contribution to the terrain, as in
</p>
<pre class="code">    LightShader L_Terrain</pre>

<p>
However, I have not yet written the <strong><code>L_Terrain</code></strong> shader, and so we have to turn off dynamic lighting for terrains:
</p>
<pre class="code">    LightShader none
    noDynLight</pre>

<p>
<img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_question.gif" class="icon" alt=":?:" /> Why do terrains not account for light by dynamic light sources? Well, there are several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Terrain is typically employed by mappers in outdoor areas that are in bright sunlight. The effect of dynamic light sources would barely be visible, if at all (but cost <em>a lot</em> of performance instead).</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Dynamic light sources are normally very “small” when being compared to the extends of terrains, and mappers tend to place them inside buildings rather than in the open area. This further limits the per-lightsource contribution on terrain surfaces.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> I simply have not yet had the time to write the <strong><code>L_Terrain</code></strong> shader.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif" class="icon" alt=":!:" /> But if for example somebody wanted to model an indoor cave with the Cafu terrain technique, having a shader that accounts for the light of dynamic light sources even on terrains would make a lot of sense. Good news is that, as indicated above, it is <em>easy</em> to write such a shader – I&#039;ll probably do so as soon as I need one.
</p>

<p>
Next, the <strong><code>A_Terrain</code></strong> (and the future <strong><code>L_Terrain</code></strong>) shader requires a diffuse-map to be specified. This diffuse-map will be scaled to match the physical size of the terrain, that is, it will cover the terrain completely. In order to get the edges of the terrain properly textured, it makes sense to also specify <strong><code>clampToEdge</code></strong> border wrapping for the diffuse texture:
</p>
<pre class="code">    diffusemap Textures/Terrains/BPRockB_tx1.png, wrapS clampToEdge, wrapT clampToEdge
    lightmap $lightmap</pre>

<p>
As the Cafu map compile tools will also generate a lightmap for the terrain in order to e.g. take sunlight or other radiosity light sources into account, we specify the <strong><code>lightmap</code></strong> keyword with the engine-supplied lightmap. Note that while the lighting of dynamic light-sources is <em>not</em> taken into account, the light of radiosity light sources <em>is</em>!
</p>

<p>
Next, the <strong><code>A_Terrain</code></strong> shader employs the texture-map that is specified with the <strong><code>lumamap</code></strong> keyword as a <em>detail-map</em> for the terrain. This is a good example for how the specification of a custom shader (here <strong><code>A_Terrain</code></strong>) can entirely alter the meaning of a material keyword. We will see below how the coarseness (the repetition-count) of the detail-map is set.
</p>
<pre class="code">    lumamap    Textures/Terrains/CommonDetail2.png      // &quot;A_Terrain&quot; takes the Luma-map as Detail-map (optional).</pre>

<p>
The detail-map is optional, and may be omitted. However, terrains look a lot better with them, and so their use is recommended.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_question.gif" class="icon" alt=":?:" /> You may be wondering wether multiple detail-maps can be handled, as for example in FarCry, where they have a detail-map for beach sand, one for rocks, one for grass and one for pavement. <br/>

<img src="/lib/images/smileys/icon_exclaim.gif" class="icon" alt=":!:" /> The answer is: The <strong><code>A_Terrain</code></strong> shader can indeed <em>not</em> handle such detail maps. But as before, it would actually be easy to write such a shader as soon as one is needed!
</p>

<p>
Finally, you need this block of statements in the body of your material definition:
</p>
<pre class="code">    shaderParamExpr fParam4    // The first eight shader parameters are taken from fParam4 to fParam11
    shaderParamExpr fParam5    // and specify the coefficients of two planes for automatic tex-coord generation.
    shaderParamExpr fParam6
    shaderParamExpr fParam7
    shaderParamExpr fParam8
    shaderParamExpr fParam9
    shaderParamExpr fParam10
    shaderParamExpr fParam11
    shaderParamExpr 21.3       // Scale / repetitions of the Detail-map.</pre>

<p>
The only thing that you may change here is the number of repetitions of the detail-map, 21.3 in the above example. The lines above that are required in order to get the terrain properly rendered and cannot reasonbly be altered.
</p>

<p>
For more information on what all the <strong><code>shaderParamExpr fParam*</code></strong> lines do, please refer to section <img src="/lib/images/smileys/fixme.gif" class="icon" alt="FIXME" /> (TODO).
</p>

<p>
Here is a complete example for a terrain shader:
</p>
<pre class="code">    Terrains/BPRockB_tx1
    {
        AmbientShader A_Terrain
        LightShader   none
        noDynLight

        diffusemap Textures/Terrains/BPRockB_tx1.png, wrapS clampToEdge, wrapT clampToEdge
        lightmap   $lightmap
        lumamap    Textures/Terrains/CommonDetail2.png

        shaderParamExpr fParam4     // The first eight shader parameters are taken from fParam4 to fParam11
        shaderParamExpr fParam5     // and specify the coefficients of two planes for automatic tex-coord generation.
        shaderParamExpr fParam6
        shaderParamExpr fParam7
        shaderParamExpr fParam8
        shaderParamExpr fParam9
        shaderParamExpr fParam10
        shaderParamExpr fParam11
        shaderParamExpr 21.3        // Scale / Repetitions of the Detail-map.

        twoSided                    // &quot;twoSided&quot; is required for the SOAR terrain algorithm.
    }</pre>

<p>
In order to turn a polygon into a translucent water surface with moving waves and reflected environment with Fresnel effect, employ the <strong><code>A_WaterCubeReflect</code></strong> shader:
<img src="/lib/images/smileys/fixme.gif" class="icon" alt="FIXME" /> (This section is not complete!)
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;section&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;The WaterCubeReflect Shader&quot;,&quot;hid&quot;:&quot;the_watercubereflect_shader&quot;,&quot;codeblockOffset&quot;:9,&quot;secid&quot;:5,&quot;range&quot;:&quot;13037-13286&quot;} -->
<h3 class="sectionedit6" id="the_none_shaders">The &quot;none&quot; Shaders</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
You can use the special <strong><code>none</code></strong> shader both as an ambient or a per-lightsource shader in order to have no shader for ambient or per-lightsource contributions at all.
</p>

<p>
As you have seen in the examples above, this makes sense in several situations. Especially materials that are not affected by local, dynamic light sources often have the <strong><code>LightShader none</code></strong> statement, as for example for sky dome. Note that currently, you still have to combine any <strong><code>LightShader none</code></strong> statement with the <strong><code>noDynLight</code></strong> statement in order to take proper effect. The <strong><code>noDynLight</code></strong> will however become obsolete in future releases of the Cafu Material System.
</p>

<p>
Using <strong><code>AmbientShader none</code></strong> is much less frequently useful, and almost only ever employed for “invisible” materials. Note that <strong><code>AmbientShader none</code></strong> also implies <strong><code>LightShader none</code></strong>. Also, in order to take proper effect, the <strong><code>noDraw</code></strong> keyword is required with each occurrence of <strong><code>AmbientShader none</code></strong>, but that requirement will be removed and <strong><code>noDraw</code></strong> be obsoleted in future versions of the <abbr title="Cafu Material System">MatSys</abbr>.
