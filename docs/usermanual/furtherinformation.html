<p>
The instructions and examples in this manual were written with reference to the <em>Microsoft Windows</em> operating systems.
Now, with Cafu being also available on <em>Linux</em>, I rely on the Linux users skills and experience to transfer the provided information to their favourite <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>.
The transfer is almost always very easy to achieve:
Examples include that Linux has <code>.tar.gz</code> file archives versus <code>.zip</code> file archives on Windows,
and that the Linux executables have no file name suffix whereas the Window executables are suffixed by <code>.exe</code>.
</p>

<p>
I hope that this helps to keep this manual easy and intuitive to understand for everyone.
The alternative would had been to mention all specifics for each <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> in each text fragment and each example.
