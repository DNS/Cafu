This section is intended for advanced users who are experienced with
downloading and installing software. If you are in a hurry and don't
want to study the entire document, but still want to make sure that you
don't miss any of the important Cafu features, you will find everything
here to get you started:

-  Installation is reduced to unzipping the downloaded file.
-  Double-clicking on ``Cafu.exe`` starts the program.
-  In the program main menu click on New Game, then select a map in the
   following screen and click Go! to start the game.
-  The ``ESC`` key opens the main menu again, where you can change game
   options or quit the game. The ``F1`` key opens the in-game console.
-  If you have questions, please consult the rest of this documentation
   first. If you can't find your answer here, please join and post a
   message at the `Cafu forums <http://forum.cafu.de>`__ – we're happy
   to help!
