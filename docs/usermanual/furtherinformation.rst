Windows and Linux specifics
---------------------------

The instructions and examples in this manual were written with reference
to the *Microsoft Windows* operating systems. Now, with Cafu being also
available on *Linux*, I rely on the Linux users skills and experience to
transfer the provided information to their favourite OS. The transfer is
almost always very easy to achieve: Examples include that Linux has
``.tar.gz`` file archives versus ``.zip`` file archives on Windows, and
that the Linux executables have no file name suffix whereas the Window
executables are suffixed by ``.exe``.

I hope that this helps to keep this manual easy and intuitive to
understand for everyone. The alternative would had been to mention all
specifics for each OS in each text fragment and each example.

.. _known_issues:

Known Issues
------------

-  The Linux port is still incomplete: The Options dialog is missing.
-  Sound drivers frequently cause problems under Linux. Therefore, Cafu
   ignores sound initialization failures on Linux, preferring no or
   broken sound output over no functionality at all.
-  The dynamic shadows are not always correct. The world is sometimes
   lit where no light should be.
-  Use the latest drivers for your video card.
-  Windows 95 and 98: Do not run Cafu from a full-screen DOS-Box. It
   will report an error.
