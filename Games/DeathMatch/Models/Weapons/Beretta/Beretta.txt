This weapon was originally meant to go in a single player mod called Half-Life:Recoil,
which was going to be a sequel to the Half-Life story. Sadly, that mod never became reality.
I was almost finished with the Beretta and since it doesn't really require any custom code, 
i decided to release it as a Glock replacement. The only problem is that the beretta should
have 15 rounds a clip instead of 17.

Note: i didn't release any custom sounds, because that is not my field of expertise, but the
normal Glock sounds work fine too. You can also use the sounds from the beretta in the 
"Action Half-Life" mod. I'll keep that to your discretion, because i don't want trouble with
the AHL team.

Installation:
Just unzip the files in the archive into your "Half-Life" folder, making sure that the "use 
folder names" option is checked. All files will automatically be placed in the correct sub-
folders. This readme file will be placed in the "Half-Life" folder.

Feel free to contact me with comments (positive or negative). You can also contact me if you 
are interested in hiring me as a (weapons) modeler for a mod.

Enjoy!!!
