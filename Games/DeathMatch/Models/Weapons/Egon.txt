by Scarecrow

This Zip File contains:

v_egon.mdl - the phaser you see in front of you when playing.
w_egon.mdl - the phaser you see lying around on the ground
p_egon.mdl - the phaser your opponent holds.

To install, unzip this zipfile into the path Sierra/Half-Life/Valve/models

The three MDL files will then sit loose in the Models folder.

Details

W_egon 68 triangles 1 skin 128x128
p_egon 68 triangles 1 skin 128x128
v_egon 837 triangles and loads of skins =(  - 6 new skins plus 4 original glove skins of varying sizes.

Sorry there are no sound effects, I couldn't find a decent clean ST:TNG phaser wav.

Do have fun...
