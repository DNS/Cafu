What is new in 1.01
 - Ammo ejection!!!


Knowing nothing about this weapon (even its name), 
I created this model because I want to make some hi-tech,
metalic-textured, projectile weapon for a change.


FACE COUNT
I -may- not exact but this is as far as I remember...
  V_model: 693 + 16
  P_model: 72
  W_model: 72
  AmmoClip: 20 (I just count this one in my mind)

SKINS
  V_model: 2x256x128 and Gordon's HEV gloves skins
  P_model: 1x128x64
  W_model: 1x128x64
  AmmoClip: 1x32x32

SOUND
  the sound in the package is already exist in Valve's pak. I just put it to wave 
  file in order to replace old 357 reload sound.

Installation:
  Use an unzip program to extract *.mdl to your <HalfLife dir>\valve\models folder.
  and .wav file go to <Half-life dir>\valve\sound\weapons

Uninstallation:
  Delete the copied files.
