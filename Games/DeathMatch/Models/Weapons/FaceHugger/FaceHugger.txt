        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I thought it was about time that the snarks were replaced, Face-Huggers from the "Alien" movies being the perfect replacements.
I've tried to animate the models as best I could but trying to animate 8 legs and a tail with Milkshape is not the easiest thing to do!
I tried to keep the poly count as low as I could get, but I had to make the "W_sqeak" model 189 polys so I could make 8 legs and a tail that could be animated.
The model work's best when used with Scarecrow's M41-A Pulse Rifle and Steve Gehrke's Colonial Marine.
Hope ya like it, It may cause more people to use the snarks........

Version 2
~~~~~~~~~~
In this new version I have updated the Egg model (w_sqknest.mdl) as It has been causing sound problems with many maps.
I decompiled the original model and there was the problem, in it's full QC glory....

$sequence idle "idle" loop fps 10 { event 5004 0 "ambience/flies.wav" } 

When I originally made the model I must have tried to get the sound of flies around the egg!
It didn't work at the time so I just left the line in there!.....the new patch must have activated the sound.....
The new version has a few extra animations that level-maker maybe able to use; Egg opening and egg open.

Sorry if this has caused any problems, but be thankful that [ALIEN] ZenMaster was around to make me aware of it....cheers mate!
