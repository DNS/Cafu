Armat M41-A Pulse Rifle for Half Life

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

10mm air-cooled automatic assault rifle featuring an integral, underslung 30mm grenade launcher. 
It needs very little introduction, since it first appeared in the mid-eightees in the movie ALIENS it has been the basis for almost every sci-fi weapon design since and goes down in history as one of the best scifi-weapon designs ever. We all know it. We all love it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This model replaces the MP5 in the standard Half Life single player and Deathmatch games.
It should also replace the MP5 in Opposing Forces but I haven't tested it.
It goes particularly well with Hoffa's Colonial Marine 'USCM' on page 6 of the Player pages on Cold Fusion

This model was made in four days using Studio MAX 2.5 and Photoshop 5
The V_Model has 892 triangles and a single 256x256 skin accompanied by the usual HEV hand skins.
The P and W models have 170 triangles and have the same, single 128x128 skin texture each.
Tha animations are all completely new but don't vary terribly much from the MP5 standards.

Start the game and the MP5 should now be a Pulse Rifle.

+++++++++++++ Known errors: ++++++++++

On the P_Weapon the stock clips in to the chest. It was either this or have it not sit properly in either of the two hands. I settled for what I consider to be the lesser of the two evils.

Also on the P_Model, the Player model's left hand cuts through the magazine. Again, totally unavoidable without either changing the shape of the gun or changing all the Half-Life player models in the whole world.
Both of these problems are totally unavoidable. Deal with it.

The third error again is with the P_Weapon. The muzzle flash attachment is half way through the gun. I've tried absolutely everything I can think of to move it and it simply won't budge. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

Other than that I'm happy with it.

One special note:
On the V weapon I switched the ammo counter and the grenade launcher ejection port to the left side to add interest. Please don't mail me telling me I got it wrong, I did it deliberatley and I don't care. 

+++++++++ THANKS ++++++++++++++++++++

My special thanks go out to Greg Hertager for sending me the photos of his replica prop which were invaluable.
I also used the Colonial Marines Technical Manual by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood and published by Boxtree. ISBN 0-7522-0844-6
