[Description]

  This is my third attempt at modelling for any game and my second ever weapon.

  It is a Bazooka, built from scratch, the shape is based roughly from the shape of the one from Kingpin and seen as I couldn't find any information on the internet (I never knew finding for information about Bazooka's or Rocket Launchers online would be so hard) so the textures and the most of it I made up myself.

  I have animated all the animations for the View weapon myself from scratch, my only problem is with the reload animation as it doesn't look quite as I wanted it, and I couldn't get it to look like I wanted either...

  Also the texture colours may be slightly off, as I'm colourblind and once I'd completed the texture I was told what I thought was Green, was actually Grey (I did try to change it, but I think changing it to 8-Bit made the Green more Greyish- but I'm not sure)
