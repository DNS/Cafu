This is my fourth skin.  I didn't decide what this character was supposed to be until I was almost 85% done with it.

"Aliens weren't the only things released by the experiments at the Black Mesa Facility.
This cybernetic construct was the prototype for a new soldier, one without a concience.
The accident at the facility occured during its programming process.  Its operating system crashed.
It rebooted and was left with only one directive: KILL."

Hope you like it.
