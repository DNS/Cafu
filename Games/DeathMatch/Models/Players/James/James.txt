Description:
This is my first model for any game and is more a result of my experimenting with techniques in 3d max.
I know people have asked for a bond model hope this will fill their needs for a while.

I chose Connery from Dr. No and Thunderball as these are my personal Favorites and this man was the first
to sport the double '0' tag. Maybe one day all the bond actors will grace our half-life or maybe a bond mod
will become a reality.

Enjoy! and remember you have a license to kill! not be Killed!
