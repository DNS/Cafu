This is an edited model previously created by Neal 'Guplik' Corbett.
I editied this model with further perfection and detail for the true matrix
fan.  I fixed, added, and edited multiple parts of the model which u can
easily notice form Guplink's  version. 
-remodeled breasts
-adjusted spine formation
-skinned the pants, boots, buckles
-added a 3D hair srand in front of her face
-remodeled boots to look femenine rather than square
-added chromed buckles to boots
-fixed the allingment of the face skin
-fixed the nostrils 
-fixed the skin colour strand that appeared on the back of her head
-skinned the shirt  (it was just a black colour like the pants)
-lightened the belt skin
