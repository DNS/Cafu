 *
 * Welcome to the <em>Cafu Engine Scripting Documentation</em>.
 *
 * This reference documentation describes the classes and functions that can occur and be used in Cafu game scripts, especially:
 *
 *   - Map scripts &ndash; Scripts for game maps that can control the entities that live within the map.
 *   - GUI scripts &ndash; Scripts that control the user interaction with the 2D GUIs (e.g. the programs main menu)
 *     and the 3D GUIs (e.g. the teleporter controls, unlock door keypads, etc.)
 *
 * Other sub-systems in Cafu are script-controlled as well, such as the in-game console,
 * the program configuration file, the render materials and sound shaders, etc.
 * For these types of script, please refer to the documentation at http://www.cafu.de/wiki/
