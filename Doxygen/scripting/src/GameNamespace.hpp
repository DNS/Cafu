/**
 * This group contains all script classes related to game worlds in Cafu.

 * Cafu game worlds are much like the real world: They are made of a hierarchy of entities.
 * Each entity has components e.g. for meshes, graphics, sound and many others, and can be interacted with.

 * TODO: This description is very incomplete -- see GuiNamespace.hpp for a better example.
