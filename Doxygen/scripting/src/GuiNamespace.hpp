/**
 * This group contains all script classes related to Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in Cafu.
 *
 * Cafu GUIs are like computer desktops: They are made of a hierarchy of windows.
 * Each window has graphical attributes and elements, it can contain text and can be interacted with.
 * GUIs can be used both in 2D, e.g. for the game's Main Menu, as well as in 3D,
 * e.g. for the in-game controls of a teleporter station, to call lifts, etc.
 *
 * GUI scripts are used both to describe the window setup and contents, as well as
 * to react to window events like mouse cursor movement and clicks, keyboard input, etc.
 * In a sense, a GUI is like a mini operating system, and the GUI scripts are the means to program it.
 *
 * For example GUI scripts, see the files in
 *   - http://trac.cafu.de/browser/cafu/trunk/Games/DeathMatch/GUIs
 *
 * GUI scripts have access to our <a href="group__Common.html">Common</a> libraries as well as
 * to (most of) the <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5">Lua standard libraries</a>.
