    ///     local soldier1 = gui:new("EntityT", "Alex")

    /// @param ClassName
    ///     The name of the class of which an object should be created.
    ///     Use `"EntityT"` in order to create a new EntityT.
    ///     Use any class name from the ComponentBaseT hierarchy in order to create a new component,
    ///     for example `"ComponentModelT"` in order to create a new model component.
    ///
    /// @param InstanceName
    ///     The name that the newly created entity instance is assigned.
    ///     Specifying a name for an entity is equivalent to setting the `Name` attribute of its Basics component;
    ///     see the example above and ComponentBasicsT.Name for details.
    ///     Setting a proper entity instance name is important so that other script code can unambiguously find
    ///     and identify the entity by name later. The CaWE Map Editor also uses it in order to automatically create
    ///     the initialization script code in the `.cent` files.
    ///     This parameter is not used (and in fact ignored) for components, which have no individual object names.

    /// This method calls the `OnInit()` script methods of all entities.
    ///
    /// Normally, the `OnInit()` callback is automatically called for each entity as soon as the
    /// `.cent` file has been read. That is, there is an automatic implicit call to Init()
    /// at the end of the `.cent` script.
    /// However, sometimes that's not enough, and you need all the entities' `OnInit()` methods already
    /// run e.g. at the top of the `.cent` script, e.g. in order to make sure that all components
    /// of all entities have been created, so that in `.cent` you can grab their instances and
    /// attach callback methods to them.
    /// In this case, call Init() manually at the top of `.cent`.
    /// (It automatically makes sure not to initialize things twice when called multiple times.)
    // /// See `DeathMatch/GUIs/MainMenu/MainMenu_main.cgui` for an example.

    /// which was a necessity in this case.
