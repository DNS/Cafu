    ///     gui:setFocus(myWin);

    /// Normally, the `OnInit()` callback is automatically called for each window as soon as the

    /// at the end of the `_main.cgui` script.

    /// run e.g. at the top of the `_main.cgui` script, e.g. in order to make sure that all components
    /// of all windows have been created, so that in `_main.cgui` you can grab their instances and
    /// attach callback methods to them.
    /// In this case, call Init() manually at the top of `_main.cgui`.
