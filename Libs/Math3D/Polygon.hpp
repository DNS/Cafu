/// This class implements convex polygons.

/// Properties / invariants of polygons:
/// 1. Polygons are always convex.
/// 2. Polygons are always on the "front" side of their plane.
/// 3. The vertices of a polygon are always ordered in clockwise (CW) order,
///    as seen from the front half-space (against the normal vectors direction) of the polygons plane.
/// 4. A polygon has at least three vertices and its plane is not degenerate, or it is the "null" polygon.
/// 5. There are no coincident vertices, that is, V[n]!=V[n+1] for all n.
