    // TODO: Extend this to not only have flags relevant to traces, but also to position (volume) tests (e.g. water, trigger, ladder, ...)??
    // (Consider if we should have a separate VolumeFlagsT enum (orthogonal to ClipFlagsT), or if this enum should be a part of the ClipFlagsT enum.)
    // (Idea: One reason for having the VolumeFlagsT seperate/orthogonal is that brushes can have "mixed" clipflags sides, but not mixed volumeflags sides.)
    // TODO: BspPortals and Radiance are actually "meta-flags" for CaBSP and CaLight, respectively, not really for the ClipSys / game-code:
    // BspPortals is for CaBSP only. CaLight may use the ClipSys or the draw BSP tree for its purposes, so Radiance is half a meta, and half a clip flag...
    // NOTE: A reaonsable consideration seems to think of maps as being made of triangle lists by 3D Modelling programs, not as brushes by CaWE.
    //       Then, it makes sense to have a VolumeFlagsT member that keeps track of the *volume* properties of the material, e.g. the "contents"
    //       of the volume like WATER, TRIGGER, PAIN, etc.  Separately stored are the *surface* properties, which may be a set of flags plus the
    //       surface type, etc. The clip flags would then be a subset of the surface properties/flags. Only remaining issue: This is currently
    //       a bit inconsistent with the assumptions of the ClipSys... REVISE!
