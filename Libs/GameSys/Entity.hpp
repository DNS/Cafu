         * This class represents game entities, which are the basic elements of a world.
         *
         * EntityT instances can be created in C++ code or in Lua scripts, using the world:new() function.
         * They can be passed from C++ code to Lua and from Lua to C++ code at will.
         * In C++ code, all EntityT instances are kept in IntrusivePtrT's. Their lifetime is properly managed:
         * An entity is deleted automatically when it is no longer used in Lua \emph{and} in C++.
         * That is, code like
         *     Example 1:    w = world:new("EntityT"); world:SetRootEntity(w); w = nil;
         *     Example 2:    w = world:new("EntityT"); w:AddChild(world:new("EntityT"));
         * works as expected. See the cf::ScriptBinderT class for technical and implementation details.
