/// This class implements Console Variables ("convars").
/// A convar is a special variable that can be modified by the user at the game console and is globally accessible in the entire application.
///
/// In user code, a convar can be declared as a global variable or as a local, static variable.
/// Use as a non-static local variable or on the heap (with new and delete) is also possible,
/// but comes at a performance cost and is against the (gobal) nature of convars.
/// Such a local variable would also never be visible at the console, and thus it makes no sense to have it.
///
/// a) Before ConVarT::RegisterStaticList() is called, all instantiated convars register themselves in a list that is global to the module,
///    that is, the exe and each dll has its own list.
/// b) Then, the ConsoleInterpreter pointer is set to point to the implementation of the ConsoleInterpreterI in the exe.
///    (There is only exactly one "global" singleton ConsoleInterpreterI instance for the entire application.)
/// c) Calling ConVarT::RegisterStaticList() then iterates over all (pointers to) convars in the per-module list,
///    and for each tries to find a convar with the same name in the unique, application-global list inside the ConsoleInterpreter.
/// d) Convars that are instantiated after the call to ConVarT::RegisterStaticList(), e.g. local static variables that are reached by the
///    control-flow for the first time, automatically register themselves with the ConsoleInterpreter directly, rather than attempting to
///    add themselves to the obsolete list from step a).
