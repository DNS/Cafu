         * This class represents a window of the GuiSys.
         * A WindowT is the most basic element of a GUI, and all other windows are derived and/or combined from this.
         *
         * WindowT instances can be created in C++ code or in Lua scripts, using the gui:new() function.
         * They can be passed from C++ code to Lua and from Lua to C++ code at will.
         * In C++ code, all WindowT instances are kept in IntrusivePtrT's. Their lifetime is properly managed:
         * A window is deleted automatically when it is no longer used in Lua \emph{and} in C++.
         * That is, code like
         *     Example 1:    w=gui:new("WindowT"); gui:SetRootWindow(w); w=nil;
         *     Example 2:    w=gui:new("WindowT"); w:AddChild(gui:new("WindowT"));
         * works as expected. See the cf::ScriptBinderT class for technical and implementation details.
