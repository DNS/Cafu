/// on the model in that pose, such as rendering, tracing rays, collision detection, etc.
///
/// The data that is derived from the anim expression is cached within the pose instance.
/// It comprises:
///   - the transformation matrices for each joint in the skeleton,
///   - the MatSys render meshes for each mesh,
///   - tangent space vectors for each vertex in each mesh.
/// In essence, this "externalizes" all data that is specific to a pose from
/// the representation of a model (the \c CafuModelT instance).
/// As a consequence, AnimPoseT instances should be shared whenever there are multiple users
/// (such as "static detail model" entity instances) that all show the same model in the same pose.
