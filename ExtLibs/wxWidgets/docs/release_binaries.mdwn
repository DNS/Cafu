wxWidgets 2.9.5 Binaries
========================

This directory contains binary files for wxWidgets 2.9.5 release.

Currently the binaries are available for Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
versions 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0 corresponding to marketing product names of
Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012 respectively.

For Developers
--------------

For developing applications with wxWidgets you need to download the
compiler-independent wxMSW-2.9.5_Headers.7z file and one of
wxMSW-2.9.5-vcXXX_Dev.7z files depending on your compiler version.
Unpack both files into the same directory so that "include" and "lib"
directories are at the same level after unpacking. You should be able
to compile and link applications using wxWidgets in both debug and
release modes but the debug symbols are provided only for debug
libraries in this archive, see below for the release build debug
symbols.


For End Users
-------------

End users may download wxMSW-2.9.5_vcXXX_ReleaseDLL.7z files to get
just the DLLs required for running the applications using wxWidgets.


For Debugging
-------------

The files wxMSW-2.9.5_vcXXX_ReleasePDB.7z contain the debug symbols
for the release build of the DLLs. Download them if you want to debug
your own applications in release build or if you want to get
meaningful information from mini-dumps retrieved from your users
machines.


Feedback
--------

This is our first attempt to provide binaries for wxWidgets libraries
and we are very interested in your feedback. Please let us know if
these files are useful to you and how could they be made more so and,
of course, if you run into any problems with them. Looking forward to
hearing from you on [wx-users mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/wx-users).
