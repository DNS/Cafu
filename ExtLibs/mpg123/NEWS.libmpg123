Changes in libmpg123 libtool interface versions...

20.0.20
	- New flag: MPG123_PLAIN_ID3TEXT
	- Corresponding text encoding handling API added:
	  mpg123_enc_from_id3, mpg123_store_utf8

19.0.19
	- Hm, what was it exactly now... there are candidates:
		- runtime dithering
		- free format
		- ARM optimizations

18.0.18
	- new parameter: MPG123_PREFRAMES is now tunable (the number of frames to decode and skip before a seek point), also default value increased

17.0.17
	- introduction optimized stereo synths

16.0.16
	- introducing floating point x86-64 SSE synth

15.0.15
	- first addition of x86-64 SSE optimizations

14.0.14
	- the first libmpg123 with actually working MPG123_UPSPEED
	- also important regression fix concerning skipping of frames

13.0.13
	- The whole set of output formats is generally available (8, 16 and 32 bit integer, signed/unsigned, float)
	- Many features can be absent from libary as build decision (minimize binary size).

12.0.12
	- added mpg123_current_decoder
	- fixed value of MPG123_ENC_FLOAT
	- float output now is a real runtime option

11.0.11
	- added mpg123_getstate
	- run-time tunable frame index
	- officially configured with largefile support where available

10.0.10
	- new flag MPG123_FUZZY (along with the fuzzy seek functionality)

9.0.9
	- added mpg123_tell_stream

8.0.8
	- added mpg123_get_eq

7.0.7
	- added mpg123_set_filesize

6.0.6
	- added mpg123_icy2utf8

5.0.5
	- added mpg123_feed
	- input buffers now const

4.0.4
	- extended mpg123_string api (mpg123_add_substring, mpg123_grow_string)

3.0.3
	- Initial floating point support as compile-time option.

2.0.2
	- New flag MPG123_SEEKBUFFER.

1.0.1
	- Added MPG123_RESYNC_LIMIT parameter.
	- Added MPG123_OUT_OF_SYNC and MPG123_RESYNC_FAIL error codes.
	- Fix for uninitialized framesize value in handle.
