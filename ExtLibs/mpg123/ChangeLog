	* trunk/configure.ac: new lib version... there have been changes

2009-06-02 18:36  thor

	* trunk/NEWS: note OS/2 state

2009-06-02 16:48  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: use macro style inline
	  asm

2009-06-01 19:43  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/sample.h: tuned the fast fixed-point
	  decoder; now fully compliant in layer3 test

2009-06-01 17:50  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/dct64.c, trunk/src/libmpg123/dct64_i386.c,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/sample.h, trunk/src/libmpg123/synth.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/synth_ntom.h, trunk/src/libmpg123/tabinit.c:
	  introducing the same technique as the MMX/SSE integer decoder.
	  now limited accracy, but faster decoder is used for the
	  fixed-point decoders when the "--enable-int-quality" switch is
	  not specified.

2009-06-01 15:56  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: faster i386_nofpu
	  decoder with inline asm; about 20% faster on core2

2009-06-01 08:01  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: more lib changes... now fully compliant
	  integer code

2009-06-01 07:53  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: more accurate
	  double-to-int rounding

2009-06-01 05:45  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,

	  trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/sample.h, trunk/src/libmpg123/tabinit.c:
	  tuned integer decoder again; significantly better than the
	  previous one.

2009-05-31 17:05  thor

	* trunk/man1/mpg123.1, trunk/src/mpg123.c: The --gain parameter is
	  deprecated (works, but only there for backwards compatibility).
	  Applied patch from Andreas Neustifter (with one added witty
	  bootnote in the man page).

2009-05-31 09:35  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: increase version for the past integer
	  decoder fixes

2009-05-31 04:46  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: fixed a bug in integer
	  layer2 decoder; should be correct now.

2009-05-30 15:49  thor

	* trunk/NEWS, trunk/src/audio.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123app.h: re-enable the gain parameter... neets
	  testing on a system that actually features hardware gain

2009-05-30 14:53  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/layer3.c: increase
	  library version, plus one small piece of conditional code for
	  REAL_IS_FIXED

2009-05-30 14:09  thor

	* trunk/src/audio.c, trunk/src/buffer.c: enable buffer to work
	  with any audio output type (that actually helped me debugging
	  for the previous commit)

2009-05-30 14:05  thor

	* trunk/NEWS, trunk/src/audio.c, trunk/src/buffer.c,
	  trunk/src/xfermem.c, trunk/src/xfermem.h: fix bug 2796802
	  (awaiting confirmation): we need to wait for the buffer to be
	  ready, not just let it loose

2009-05-30 07:11  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/layer1.c, trunk/src/libmpg123/layer2.c,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/layer3.c,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: more accurate fixed
	  point decoder; still not perfect, but quite good. also fixes
	  totally broken fixed point layer 1/2 decoder.

2009-05-27 16:18  taihei

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/dct64_i386.c: fix for
	  i386_nofpu decoder; real and s32 output should be disabled for
	  it, and dct64_i386 should use REAL_MUL macro for multiplications

2009-05-26 06:26  thor

	* trunk/man1/mpg123.1: add space between --pitch and its parameter

2009-05-24 00:37  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: that is a new lib version

2009-05-24 00:30  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: provide means to enable buffer where system

	  the standard one? :p) in x86-64 asm functions; I'm not sure if
	  this works well, but I hope this helps...

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/readers.c: also do nott check for
	  anticipated file end in the ICY reader...

2009-05-19 14:35  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/readers.c: Do not anticipate file end,
	  always wait for read() indicating real EOF (hopefully fixes bug
	  2793677 with embedded ID3v1).

2009-05-19 09:55  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c: do nott included unnecessary headers in
	  mpg123.c

2009-05-18 14:15  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: load config.h earlier to
	  make the ABI_ALIGN_FUN work again, thanks to Leandro for
	  spotting this (still needs testing)

2009-05-18 08:21  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/synth_3dnow.S: supported accurate rounding
	  for 3dnow decoder

2009-05-17 21:42  patr3ck

	* trunk/ports/MSVC++/2008/libmpg123/libmpg123.vcproj: Catch up
	  with Taihai's latest additions to SSE optimized decoding

2009-05-17 19:38  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: there is no synth_stereo_sse.S

2009-05-17 13:29  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: organize the --with-int-quality code...
	  choose either set of sources, not always both

2009-05-17 11:19  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/Makefile.am: Enable RPATH builds for
	  dithering decoders by using full path to dnoise.sh. Just a note
	  again, for funny paths: Spaces in source path will blow up with
	  autoconf. Do not forget that.

2009-05-17 06:21  taihei

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/Makefile.am,

	  16bit decoder for SSE and x86-64 -- should be used when
	  --enable-int-quality=yes is specified - added optimized s32
	  synth for SSE

2009-05-17 00:36  thor

	* trunk/man1/mpg123.1, trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/mpg123app.h:
	  add --preframes, update documentation

2009-05-17 00:22  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/readers.c: do not seek back to an index
	  position when we are already closer to the aim

2009-05-16 23:44  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/libmpg123.c: Be smarter
	  about seeking.. prevent unnecessary back-seeks when we are on
	  track already.

2009-05-16 22:58  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/format.c: reduce verbosity of format
	  matching code... people get irritated by mentioning of
	  resampling where there is no resampling

2009-05-16 22:26  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/sample.h: compile-time choice for integer
	  accuracy default is the truncation as before, as it's the
	  fastest and casual people won't notice, but there is ./configure
	  --enable-int-quality to make integer conversion more proper and
	  improve the accuracy in the LSB.

2009-05-16 09:25  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/libmpg123.c,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123.h.in, trunk/src/libmpg123/readers.c:
	  Non-seekable streams can still go forwards, that idea has been
	  in the code, but not used. This is hard on the border for things
	  one should not add during stabilizing a release. I know.

2009-05-16 09:23  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c: Do not try to skip 0 frames, that can
	  unnecessarily break playback of non-seekable streams.

2009-05-16 09:17  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/id3.c: fix ID3v2 RVA2 parsing of negative
	  values, see bug #2792417

2009-05-16 09:14  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: for completeness, add int16_t

2009-05-14 15:49  patr3ck

	* trunk/ports/MSVC++/2008/libmpg123/libmpg123.vcproj: Add .S files
	  and mpg123.h.in to the project to make MSVC SVN plugins work
	  correctly. Suggested by TheVinn.

2009-05-14 14:43  patr3ck

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: I should have removed
	  the inline and leave the static in place.

2009-05-14 14:41  patr3ck

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: Removed static before
	  inline. It gave compile errors on MSVC++. Spotted and fix
	  suggested by TheVinn on IRC.

2009-05-14 07:25  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h: faster accurate rounding

2009-05-13 07:47  taihei

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,
	  trunk/src/libmpg123/synth_altivec.c: REAL_TO_SHORT should round
	  fp value to the nearest integer, without truncation. This makes
	  16-bit integer output of the generic (and altivec) decoder fully
	  compliant with the standard (but slower). ==== Layer 1 ====

	* trunk/NEWS.libmpg123: lib news... MPG123_PREFRAMES
	* trunk/configure.ac: fix nofpu decoder build (disable 32bit and

2009-05-10 23:36  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/mpg123lib_intern.h,

2009-05-10 22:17  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/frame.c: Settling on preframes=4 per
	  default, with fixed upper limit of 2 for layer 1 and 2, as well
	  as lower limit 1 for layer 3.

2009-05-10 21:56  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/libmpg123.c: Reset frame buffers before
	  seeks. That helps to get the first sample accurately... and
	  generally. Now I need 2 preframes for layer 1 and 2 compliance
	  bitstreams, 4 for layer 3.

2009-05-10 21:46  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/frame.c, trunk/src/tests/seek_accuracy.c:
	  Resuming work on seek accuracy. Layer 3 is mostly fine, layer 1
	  and 2 gives me creeps. They work now basically, but also only
	  with certain preframes values. Also, getting the first sample
	  again always fails. Will try to reinit decoder for that case...
	  or in any case...

2009-05-10 21:20  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/getbits.h: Importing a C version of getbits.
	  That fixes layer1 decoding. I am not sure what exactly went
	  wrong with the macro, but the C code makes mpg123 a compliant
	  layer 1 decoder again. This should be no performance regression,
	  at least it is none on my system. The C code is still in the
	  header, ready to be inlined for the same result. Maybe I will
	  move all getbits macros to static C functions...

2009-05-10 21:17  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/libmpg123.c: does not need getbits

2009-05-10 19:27  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/parse.c: Fix the
	  breakage that the layer2 testing brought to light: The parser
	  screamed header change on changes between stereo modes. I got
	  that check wrong... funny, that this doesn't jump on your feet
	  with real world files... that much, at least. To elaborate a
	  bit: The breakage meant too many decoder buffer
	  reinitializations during the stream, introducing some tickling,
	  and, of course, breaking seek sample value accuracy.

2009-04-30 23:24  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/libmpg123/optimize.c: Make SSE the
	  first choice for x86. It is generally faster than 3DNowExt on
	  AMD CPUs that support both (especially once Taihei brings in the
	  improved dct64 for SSE). The optimized dct36 seems even to make
	  it _slower_ for K7 and K8. On K6 it is faster than plain dct36.
	  Need to check how it is on early K7 without SSE unit.

2009-04-30 14:10  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: Quickfix for configure... libtool uses
	  $EGREP without checking for it. This is apparently collateral
	  damage from libltdl removal ... and it seems wrong having to
	  check for that program manually.

2009-04-29 10:17  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/optimize.c: Use the SSE-optimized real
	  synths in 3DNowExt decoder when CPU can do SSE, too. Still open
	  is the question of SSE being faster on some CPUs that can do
	  3DNowExt (namely AMD64). AthlonXPs are a bit faster on
	  3DNowExt... but the margin is so tigth that some tweaked
	  optimization to the SSE code would overcome it easily, I guess.

2009-02-14 10:06  thor

	* trunk/src/libmpg123/optimize.c: Most probably pinned bug
	  2472726. I finally have been able to reproduce it with the help
	  of valgrind, which changed the memory management. After a
	  resync, the frame buffers get (re)allocated, in case of the
	  decwin, that's a free() of the old and immediately malloc() of
	  the new. With normal glibc memory management that resulted in
	  the same block of memory than before being assigned (when the
	  size did not change). Thus, the failure to call
	  make_decode_tables on the new memory ws hidden because the old
	  values were still there. So, the easy fix is to call
	  make_decode_tables everytime after changing the frame buffers.
	  Waiting for confirmation from the Windows folks...

	  optimization only kicks in for certain modes (1to1 16bit, 8bit).
	  - Formats include floating point output in every non-fixed-math
	  build (Yay!). - Redundant code has been merged into the synth*
	  headers. - A possible downside: compiling synth.c is a bit of
	  work, may split that again into synth, synth_8bit, etc. One has
	  to do some side-by-side comparison with 1.6.x with respect to
	  output and speed. I could be that one should re-insert some
	  optimized dct64 in some places (apart from synth_1to1). Well, I
	  hope things are a bit cleaner now... though I don't claim
	  they're less complicated;-)

	  optimized to zero at compile time... while at runtime the result
	  is wrong. This depends on some optimization included in -O1

	  Reacting to a wish list item... and adding a kinda cool feature
	  there: A --pitch parameter as well as interactive terminal
	  control for playback speed control via the output (hardware)
	  sample rate. I first considered using the software "resampling"
	  of libmpg123 but this way it has the best possible quality and
	  the least cpu impact (that is, basically none;-). It is the
	  mpg123 way! Plus, if your hardware doesn't support many rates or
	  you really, really want your CPU do the work, just use an output
	  module like alsa with default (plughw) device or portaudio that
	  will do the resampling in software. That being said... I just
	  found out that my laptop's sound chip can actually do a bit more

	  of 1889051 is a false positive for the fist header; which
	  _passes_ the text for a following valid header after that frame.
	  What a coincidence... Should I test for the next 2 frames?
	  MPlayer doesn't show the short distortion that mpg123 shows in
	  decoding the first (invalid, but strangely decodable) frame.
	  Guess the best to do is to finally rewrite that frame
	  reading/searching function to be more consistent and tunable for
	  - bytes of junk to skip - resync limit (we have that already) -
	  number of frames/headers readahead for assuring a valid stream I
	  would like to have a 1.2.1 release with just the last bugfix
	  (endless loop in resync) and perhaps a variant of the current
	  hack after I spent some more thought and testing on it (does
	  mpg123 still pass the nasty test files that made me make the
	  resync that strickt?). Then, for 1.3.0, the tunable resync

2007-12-08 02:46  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/term.c: Fix buffer behaviour with
	  seeking, in the only way that seemed workable: When you press a
	  seek key in buffer mode, the buffer is stopped and you can seek
	  in peace to your position (makes most sense to have verbosity
	  turned on). After reaching the position, you have to press the
	  stop/un-stop key to restart playback. Seeking wile listening to
	  the bits passing by is really, really non-trivial with the
	  buffer because of the timing between keypress repeats and the
	  buffer refilling. When you want it really interactive, you don't
	  want to have the buffer in between... I think the current
	  solution is close to a local optimum for this, it's the tradeoff
	  you have to do. Even seeking _inside_ the buffer won't help
	  seeking backwards, as the refill would kick in in the same way.

	  trunk/src/xfermem.h: More communicative buffer and normalized
	  usage of which. No nastly killing or SIGSTOP anymore; buffer
	  either plays or waits for commands, including termination. This
	  fixes the terminal behaviour with track skip and seek when
	  stopped: The buffer can be resynced while being stopped, so no
	  forced restart of playback on track skip anymore. The only
	  nagging usability issue remaining with the buffer is the
	  inability to seek while playing. Refilling of the buffer effects
	  in fast-forward only.

	  works normally, v19 just wants to block or segfault on my box.

	* trunk/src/audio.c, trunk/src/audio.h, trunk/src/buffer.c,

	  rework, mainly to clean up the mess with the buffer. The initial
	  reason was to install safeguards against multiple ao->close()
	  operations, which was done, too. Now either the buffer or the
	  main mpg123 process touch the audio devices; in the buffered
	  case the main program querying the buffer process for audio
	  capabilities. That and some other potential bug(s) fixed. This

	  it ESD, perhaps only ESD people themselves say ESounD...). Also,

	  Worked on the win32 crash... found out that the access to the
	  exported (?!) array mpg123_rates[] and/or mpg123_encodings[]
	  blows with the DLL. Exporting functions to access the arrays
	  instead seems to work; and is generally the better way, perhaps.
	  So there is an API change from mpg123_rates[] to
	  mpg123_rates(const long **, size_t *) and likewise for
	  mpg123_encodings. Along with the win32 hacking I actually
	  enabled the EXPORT define stuff, but this made no difference
	  anyway (I guess libtool just uses libmpg123.sym and that's it).
	  Another issue, interwoven but unrelated (sorry...) is the
	  hacking of autotool stuff to omit C++, F77 compiler tests that
	  libtool macros trigger. A future version of libtool shall be
	  fixed and won't need these hacks.

2007-12-04 10:54  thor

	  I should really just let these pointers point to an empty string
	  when there is no info? Even if there is an empty string, the

	  -Wno-error into CFLAGS doesn't really work (not properly, at
	  least)... and also the exiting working with CFLAGS that
	  influence the foolowing tests in configure was not good. Now we
	  are a bit more careful with the mods (also redirecting -DSTUFF
	  to CPPFLAGS instead of CFLAGS) and there is a blocker check at
	  beginning. configure will just fail when there is -Werror in the
	  flags, because it is really bad with several tests. Note that
	  this also implies that make distcheck will always fail in this
	  controlled way when run after a configure that generated CFLAGS
	  with -Werror. These generated CFLAGS are carried over to the
	  configure run in the distcheck dir... dunno if and how one could

	  more info directly accessible; which id3dump now does access -
	  adapted id3print.c to the pointer thing (by dropping some & ;-)

	* trunk/Makefile.am, trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/Makefile.am,
	  trunk/src/output/Makefile.am: Serious autotool hacking. By now
	  you should be able to get - a standard dynamic build with shared
	  lib and auto-detected modules - a dynamic build with a selected
	  range of modules (--with-audio) - the default audio module you
	  want via --with-default-audio - a one-static-module build with
	  shared lib (--disable-modules) - a one-static-module build with
	  static lib (--disable-modules --disable-shared) - a fully static
	  build (-static in LDFLAGS when running configure) The
	  static-module builds skip the libltdl configure step. This just

	  fresh frame number is -1 before read_frame and 0 for the first
	  frame after that. The funny part is, that the buggy variant
	  agrees with 0.59r and the corrected has a shift of 1 frame for
	  many mp3 files: 0.59r does not recognize the LAME tag and plays
	  a frame of silence instead. So, now it should be correct, albeit
	  differing from old mpg123.

2006-11-30 11:16  thor

	* trunk/src/httpget.c, trunk/src/playlist.c, trunk/src/readers.c:
	  adding acceptance of MIME types application/pls and audio/x-mpeg
	  ... Perhaps this list of aliases for playlists and streams has
	  to grow further...

2006-11-20 09:08  thor

	* trunk/src/audio_oss.c: Remove byteswapping code that got
	  accidentally reactivated (OSS output now simply requests native
	  endianess) - thanks for pointing out, DK!

2006-11-02 17:32  thor

	* trunk/src/id3.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/mpg123.h: merged
	  pasky's ide about adaptive condensed tag display and made it
	  default; added --long-tag option for the previous, space taking,
	  variant (one may prefer it on occasion)

2006-11-02 17:09  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/id3.c: de-verbose, moved notes at
	  least one verbosity level up There was too much noise...

2006-11-02 16:40  thor

	* trunk/src/id3.c, trunk/src/stringbuf.c: adapting and fixing
	  pasky's (Petr Baudi) utf emergency patch (at least interpreting
	  and converting to lating1/ascii where possible), avoids messing
	  up the terminal when encountering unicode

2006-10-31 19:02  njh

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/audio_macosx.c: Applied patch from
	  Taihei Monma to using AudioUnit API instead of coreaudio API

2006-10-30 03:15  thor

	* trunk/AUTHORS, trunk/src/term.c: term patch (restore on sigcont)
	  from petr baudis

2006-10-24 21:56  thor

2006-10-09 22:14  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac: configure update for kfreebsd (bsd with gnu
	  userspace) and cygwin (no assembler by default, oss instead of

2006-10-09 21:42  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/control_generic.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.h: Slimmed the ugly #ifdef REAL_IS... stuff in
	  scanf based on central format definition in mpg123.h; also added
	  such safe format for a printf (sendmsg). Jens Wilhelm Wulf
	  suggested something like that. I agree.

2006-10-05 16:04  thor

	* trunk/mpg123.1: we can do mpeg 2.5!

2006-09-30 16:10  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/common.h, trunk/src/readers.c: Ok,
	  Struggled a while to nail bug 1556471. We have now (for seekable
	  streams) a basic read ahead for finding the real first frame.
	  The next step would be to make every resync use that, but the
	  most important situation is nasty garbage at beginning of file.
	  I also loosened the HDRCMPMASK to allow changing bitrate - the
	  resync disregards valid VBR frames otherwise.

2006-09-27 17:15  thor

	* trunk/src/control_generic.c, trunk/src/layer3.c,

	  also cover the pause-seek-unpause case where not a gap but a
	  tick from the grave is the problem (because of old frames
	  influencing new ones at different location in stream). I don't

	  display of id3v2 text info fields. The code for that was
	  outsourced from common.c - that file contained too much "common"

	  didn't do it for mmapped mode and I think I'll erase that one
	  soon, anyway (you can use stuff like /dev/shm or just trust your
	  kernel buffers). There are some changes more or less related to

	  VBR seek now...

2006-08-21 12:56  thor

	* trunk/src/httpget.c: adding workaround for rautemusik internet

2006-08-21 11:58  thor

	* trunk/src/audio_alsa.c, trunk/src/term.c: Now more proper alsa
	  code from clemens; fixing the remaining buffer mode crashes by
	  making term.c more aware of the fact that if there is a buffer,
	  no one else should mess with the audio device.

2006-08-17 07:46  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/readers.c: Ok, changed the check
	  in read_frame back to comparig the new header with first and old
	  header. That is a pragmatic change that gives some false
	  negatives but still allows seeking in this one evil file at all.
	  Blind seeking in vbr files is evil.

2006-08-17 07:38  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/common.h, trunk/src/readers.c:
	  Started workign on the seeking (and fixed the second-time id3v2
	  recognition to happen in quiet mode , too, by the way). The
	  seeking is a mess but necessarily so for vbr files that we don't
	  have a frame mapping for (from Xing header - not used atm,
	  though). Now the seeking at least works for this one very vbr
	  file (where no frame is like the first!) where formerly any
	  seekl lead directly to end-of-track. There is a tradeoff: Now we
	  get false positives from time to time. We should treat
	  Xing-tagged vbr files with all the info we have and at least
	  warn about vbr files that lack the seeking info.

2006-08-17 00:06  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/common.h,
	  trunk/src/control_generic.c: One place to calculate current

2006-08-12 19:15  thor

	* trunk/src/layer3.c: this common "error" message is better just
	  for debugging

2006-08-12 19:04  thor

	* trunk/src/layer3.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c: Printing wanted help to
	  stdout is a good idea, printing the mpg123 hello lines on stdout
	  with the -s switch possibly in work is a bad one. Shame on you...

2006-08-08 01:34  thor

2006-08-08 01:31  thor

2006-08-08 01:18  thor

	* trunk/src/audio_alsa.c: Clemens Ladisch rightfully erased my
	  dirty hack and made proper Alsa API check for initialized
	  device;-)

2006-08-08 01:15  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/config.h.legacy: Too late again...
	  feverishly hacked reading of RVA values from ID3v2 in 3 variants
	  - ID3v2.4 RVA2 frames - RVA_* style comment fields - TXXX fields
	  from foobar2000 (untested)

2006-08-07 08:48  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c: Got a good deal of ID3v2 parsing... now
	  wondering why I cannot derive the correct size of the Image in
	  this Mike Zee file. id3v2 -l sees it correctly; I parse the size
	  value - and that simply is wrong?!! After I've settled that the
	  file is just broken and id3v2 does play some trick, I can go
	  back to store RVA values...

2006-08-06 17:48  thor

	* trunk/TODO: being more clear there on gain and types

2006-08-06 17:45  thor

	* trunk/src/readers.c: We have to stop using ints everywhere for
	  byte counts... future TODO.

2006-08-06 17:20  thor

	* trunk/README.gain, trunk/src/common.c: going to make id3v2
	  parsing properly... since not even id3lib can handle 2.4:-(

2006-08-06 17:02  thor

	* trunk/README.gain, trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/common.c: some
	  clarification adding to the confusion - did I already say that
	  all this tagging is a MESS?

2006-08-06 16:20  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.h: should we limit samples to 2**16/2 or
	  2**16/1-1? there will be a one missing in the first case... or

2006-08-06 13:21  thor

	* trunk/mpg123.1, trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.h: initial RVA support using ReplayGain values

2006-08-06 11:02  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/httpget.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.h: some more explicit/corrected system header
	  dependencies along with fallback (for SIZE_MAX, ULONG_MAX), in
	  common.c the maximal frame count for gapless is now actually
	  depending on the system limit

2006-08-06 10:25  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/layer3.c: some more unified error
	  messages

2006-08-06 00:39  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c: 1. re-enable MPEG 2.5 as I could be actually
	  safe to do so 2. bail out on free format header if first one (so
	  supposedly not just stream distortion) 3. _not_ bail out on
	  decode_header failure ... perhaps this is no good idea?

2006-08-05 22:40  thor

	* trunk/src/layer3.c: comment about mhipp bandinfo change...
	  should we change?

2006-08-05 21:38  thor

	* trunk/src/layer3.c: say what's wrong on bad sideinfo

2006-08-05 17:06  thor

	* trunk/src/layer3.c: Widen the bugfix for the Stravinsky fuzzing
	  ... there are files where xrpnt does exceed that range is
	  supposedly should have (?), pointing to end+4 bytes. Since these
	  play fine now and sounded wrong with the strict check, I hope
	  this is justified. when will I have time to really understand
	  the core decoding routines and their pointers?

	* trunk/src/common.c: more standard error messages

2006-08-05 14:55  thor

	* trunk/src/httpget.c, trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/mpg123.h,
	  trunk/src/readers.c: fixing bug id 1529319... and overreacting a
	  bit about the whole issue: - initialy made steps to HTTP/1.1
	  (for the host header field because of virtual hosts support) but
	  retreated after realizing that one has to accept chunked data -
	  now still HTTP/1.0 with host header as extension (as before,
	  actually), also again sending only absolute paths as requests
	  (no full url) but still allowing relative redirects - using the
	  content-type header field to prevent playback of wrong codec and
	  to more safely recognice playlist files - one result: for a
	  single we resource one can always use the -@ switch: playlists
	  are treated as playlists and if it is an audio/mpeg file, it is
	  reopened as such - added most simple parsing of pls (shoutcast)
	  playlists

2006-07-29 06:02  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c: explicitly handle failed http_open

2006-07-29 05:03  thor

	* trunk/src/httpget.c: make sure that httpauth1 doesn't leak
	  memory... oaranoid

2006-07-29 04:49  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c: 1. noted a memory leak on strdup but not
	  fixed yet 2. fruitless debugging of terminal mindbreaking
	  characters from a internet radio playlist. Probably these are
	  actually send by the server.

2006-07-28 13:45  thor

	* trunk/src/httpget.c: fixing bug 1529266; the segfault happening
	  on the second http request was due to a global pointer
	  (httpauth1) being free()d but not nulled.

2006-07-24 11:32  thor

	* trunk/CHANGES: beta2 update just before real release...

2006-07-24 11:10  thor

2006-07-24 11:08  thor

	* trunk/src/mpg123.c, trunk/src/mpg123.h, trunk/src/term.c: Oh,

2006-07-17 22:37  thor

	* trunk/mpg123.1, trunk/src/mpg123.c: - seen that manpage needs a
	  lot of updating (nearly ten years old!) - made the wanted usage
	  info (-?, --help, --longhelp) go to stdout and only the
	  help-on-error to stderr - added --version to give program

2006-07-17 21:04  thor

	* trunk/src/common.c, trunk/src/control_generic.c,

2006-07-17 01:01  thor

	* trunk/configure.ac, trunk/src/audio_alsa.c,

	  sane setup using alsa today (meaning: not using the 0.5 api).
	  New doesn't work because unfinished yet. Alsa output actually is

2006-07-10 02:23  thor

	* trunk/src/audio_libao.c: Polished the libao output a bit while
	  testing it on my linux laptop: - parsing -a driver:file for file
	  devices (well, this could be extended to a general scheme to
	  choose between different driver subsystems via -a system:file or
	  system:device:file ...) - corrected the error handling: -1 is
	  expected on error by mpg123.c - giving help message with list of
	  available drivers when invalid one is specified I verified with
	  one testfile that -a wav:file does the same as -w file. I think
	  that this is good;-) Also, I'd like to mention that it's nice to
	  measure audio subsystem overhead with comparing -t and -a null.
	  With the libao in place, I'm wondering if we still want our own
	  alsa output... let's see...

2006-07-06 14:00  thor

	* buglog/mathias_wenzel_stress.txt, trunk/src/common.c,

	  robust based on an evil mp3 (see the buglog file). Most
	  important featur of this robustness could be that mpg123 doesn't

	* trunk/TODO, trunk/src/httpget.c: Revised my bugfix for the last

	  (malloc without free for assigned pointer) - now accepting
	  non-absolute redirects; request now is always of the form GET
	  http://host/path HTTP/1.0 (non-absolute relocations are related
	  to this request) That also works flawlessly with my virtual

	  be more efficient now and also more aggressive by just skipping
	  decoder delay even if no info found and also adding decoder
	  delay to end (hm, where does this really make sense without
	  padding removal?). It should be more efficient now; a comparison
	  between linux-x86 binary (pentium) with and without gapless code
	  shows perhaps around 0.2% speed penalty through added code -
	  which already melts when gapless mode is actually active.
	  Generally on speed: comparison with 0.59r (linux build,
	  non-marched cflags (pentium2)) shows around 2% slower decoding
	  for svn trunk; but this is greatly compensated by using one of
	  the new assembler optimizations. Still, I see much code that can
	  be improved also for efficiency alone by clearing the situation
	  with some (shared) variables that don't need to be passed around
	  all the time...

2006-07-03 12:55  thor

	* trunk/src/Makefile.legacy, trunk/src/common.c,
	  trunk/src/common.h, trunk/src/control_generic.c,
	  trunk/src/layer3.c, trunk/src/layer3.h, trunk/src/mpg123.c,
	  trunk/src/mpg123.h: Main message: The gapless mode has been
	  enhanced to work more low-level (in layer3.c) and also to use
	  the Xing-given frame count to get the end straight. It should
	  work (tested, but not in every detail) both with the -k option
	  and terminal controlled seeking as well as control_generic
	  JUMPs. The current implementation adds some load that could be
	  reduced by putting the gapless checker code into behind flush
	  check instead of before but that needs additional care for track
	  end (where audio_flush is called externally). Apart from that
	  and some needed de-uglification it should be a nicely working
	  feature. Minor messages: frameNum is unsigned long (so bigger
	  that int and never < 0!); some parts of mpg123.c and common.c
	  did not honor these truths. But I don't claim that I catched all
	  occurences of such problems - see BUGS. Also, I fixed stuff in
	  print_stat with weird frame number estimations. Looks _much_
	  better now esp. when the frame count is known from Xing tag.

	  one. 0.59r-ThOr(remote-err,eq,flushing) - added audio_flush()
	  calls to various places in control_generic.c to make sure there
	  is nothing left in there that hurts later
	  0.59r-realeq-remoteerr: - applied patch from Cool Feet Audio
	  project (nutcase@dtfm.org, see README.cfa) to use real-time
	  equalizer in remote mode - applied patch from AMF
	  (amf.sourceforge.net) by Steve Grundell for remote communication
	  not polluting the STDOUT where the audio data is read from
	  (instead using STDERR) ... and faster seeking, maybe The patches
	  go not cleanly together, but rejects are trivial. Thus, a
	  combined patch with both would makes sense. - modified (IMHO
	  improved) the control_generic command reading: now always making
	  sure that the full command is read up to a mandatory \n; also
	  reworked the application of the commands afterwards - added SEQ
	  command: simple eq with only 3 bands - added SILENCE command: I
	  don't want the playback messages when I don't read them (since
	  my frontend is reading the STDOUT it knows what is going on) -
	  added SLJ command: SILENCE-LOAD-JUMP... a hack for my hacked
	  mixplayd... maybe one should remove that again.

	  more) - added simple rewind facility .. (only used by sajber
	  interface at the moment)

	  .. mpg123 understands and plays 2.5 but it does it wrong. (you
	  will hear this!) - Fixed wrong values in BandInfo struct for
	  32kHz mode - Some performance improvements and minor changes and
	  bug-fixes. - Tried the new imdct from the maplay1.2+ (version
	  1.81) package. (but it was slightly slower on my system,
	  currently disabled) 0.59f: (OF) ------ HP-UX audio fix (provided
	  by Damien Clermonte). Buffering (-b option) hopefully fixed.
	  Please test!

	  'dct64.o' in Makefile 0.59c: (OF) ------ Another complete rework
	  of the buffer system (-b option) (normally uses mmap(), but it
	  can also use SYSV-ShMem because mmap() is broken on linux).

	  extracted dct64() from decode*.c files. some changes to dct64()
	  and decode*.c to allow auto-increment/decrement removed
	  bit-counter in getbit-functions. Layer3 part2 now counts it
	  itself. 0.58: (OF) ----- Bugfix: not closing the audio device
	  caused a few samples to be lost. Bugfix: audio_set_rate() was
	  not called (!?!). Additional command line options
	  "--doublespeed" and "--halfspeed" (couldn't find better names).
	  See the manpage. Complete redesign of command line options. See
	  the manpage. Changed the buffer algorithm (-b). I'm not sure
	  whether it's better or worse now. Supports multiple files on the
	  command line. Pressing Ctrl-C will skip to the next MPEG file,
	  pressing it twice within one second will abort mpg123
	  completely. See the "INTERRUPT" section in the manpage. Support
	  for http URLs. See also the -p option in the manpage. Support
	  for list files. See also the -@ option in the manpage.

	  downsampling code together with the full quality decode into one
	  binary. (new options -2to1,-4to1) Optimizations in the dct12.
	  Removed the 'int' version. 0.56: (OF) ----- Additional command
	  line option "-rs" to try to resync on "broken" MPEG streams (now
	  called "--resync" or "-y"). Additional command line option "-b"
	  to use audio output buffering. See the manpage for additional
	  information. Changed a few variable names and some other minor
	  fixes, so the source compiles more cleanly (without warnings) on
	  most platforms (for example, the FreeBSD port compiles without
	  warnings using "-Wall -ansi -pedantic"). Makefile changes: moved
	  "solaris" to "solaris-gcc", new target "solaris" (using Sun's
	  SparcWorks cc, faster tha gcc!), new targets "aix" and "generic".
