Changes since the last public release (1.2.41):

version 1.2.42 [January 3, 2010]

  Removed "#define PNG_NO_ERROR_NUMBERS" that was inadvertently added
    to pngconf.h in version 1.2.41.
  Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
    to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng12 instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng12.
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from scripts/makefile.darwin
    and contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c; the
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising changes made in 1.2.41)
  Swapped PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED and PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in pngset.c to be consistent with other changes in version 1.2.38.
  Avoid deprecated references to png_ptr-io_ptr and png_ptr->error_ptr
    in pngtest.c
