Changes since the last public release (1.4.7):

  Undef "_ALL_SOURCE" for AIX, to prevent "jmpbuf" from being redefined.
  Copied png_debug macros from pngpriv.h into pngtest.c and removed
    "#include pngpriv.h" from pngtest.c, to avoid setting a bad example.
  Pass "" instead of '\0' to png_default_error() in png_err().  This mistake
    was introduced in libpng-1.2.20beta01.
  Check for up->location !PNG_AFTER_IDAT when writing unknown chunks
    before IDAT.
  Ported bugfix in pngrtran.c from 1.5.3: when expanding a paletted image,
    always expand to RGBA if transparency is present.
  Ported bugfix in pngrtran.c from 1.5.3: Ensure coefficients are OK for
    png_rgb_to_gray_fixed(); check for integer overflow in
    png_set_rgb_to_gray().
  Fixed uninitialized memory read in png_format_buffer() (Bug report by
    Frank Busse, related to CVE-2004-0421).
  Fixed error in "ACCURATE" 16-to-8 scaling (John Bowler).
  Check for sCAL chunk too short.
