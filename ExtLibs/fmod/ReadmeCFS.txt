This is the FMOD 3.75 Programmers API from <http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download>.
The FMOD 3.x libraries are redistributed with Cafu with explicit permission from Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd.

Note: The use of the FMOD library in Cafu is optional.
It is used in some of the Cafu sound systems, and can easily
be replaced by other sound technologies (e.g. pure OpenAL).

###
### Note that for use in commercial products, you have to obtain a commercial
### license from Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd. as detailed in the README.TXT file.
### (Alternatively, use the OpenAL-based implementation of the Cafu Sound System.)

In order to save diskspace, we merged the APIs for the Win32 and Linux platforms
(which were separate downloads from the above URL) in this directory.

For the same reason, we removed/omitted the following directories:
    api/delphi
    api/vb
    documentation
    media
    samples
    samplesdelphi
    samplesvb
    tools
