class MapElementT;


/// This class represents an orthogonal BSP tree (axis-aligned split planes) that spatially organizes MapElementT instances.
///
/// A map element is generally linked in each leaf that it intersects, or instead whenever possible in the node closest to the
/// root where the element intersects *all* children.
/// Note that the latter is an optional feature that yields a tree that is logically equivalent to the pure "store all contents
/// in leaves" strategy (where nodes generally remain empty and store no contents at all), but in comparison saves some storage.
/// Also note the subtle difference to storing some contents in nodes (the elements that intersect a split plane) and some (the
/// rest) in leaves, like ancient version of our CaBSP: Keeping some contents in nodes like this would make it impossible to
/// determine the contents (the set of all map elements) that are inside a given node, because the set would be grossly oversized.
/// Our "extended leaves-only" approach saves both storage and is able to produce for each node the exact set of map elements
/// (required e.g. for view frustum tests).
///
/// Another feature of this implementation is that the bounding-box of a node is usually *not* the tight bounding-box over its
/// contents, but typically larger:
/// The bounding-box of the root node is the maximum bounds of the world, the bounding-box of its children is determined by
/// subdividing it along the split plane, etc. As such, the bounding-boxes in the tree only depend on the split planes, but not
/// directly on the contents of the nodes (and thus the BB member of the NodeT class is const).
///
/// Finally, note how these larger bounding-boxes affect the tree structure and size. There are two important differences:
/// 1. Where we would not have node planes at the outmost brush faces with a "tight" starting box, our approach definitively
///    comes up with these outmost walls as split planes sooner or later. This enlarges the tree, but these extra nodes are
///    fortunately not completely useless: When the user extends the map spatially, the extra nodes come in just handy.
/// 2. The center of our larger boxes is often different from the center of the tight bounding-boxes, as the tight boxes are
///    usually not symmetric to the origin. This causes different split planes to be chosen when the tree is built.
///    As with issue 1. though, this difference is not a principal or serious problem.
