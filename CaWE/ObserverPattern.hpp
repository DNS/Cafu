/// \file
/// This file provides the classes for the Observer pattern as described in the book by the GoF.
/// Note that implementations of ObserverT normally maintain a pointer to the subject(s) that they observe,
/// e.g. in order to be able to redraw themselves also outside of and independent from the NotifySubjectChanged() method.
/// This however in turn creates problems when the life of the observer begins before or ends after the life of the observed subject(s).
/// In fact, it seems that the observers have to maintain lists of valid, observed subjects as the subjects maintain lists of observers.
/// Fortunately, these possibly tough problems can (and apparently must) be addressed by the concrete implementation classes of
/// observers and subjects, not by the base classes that the Observer pattern describes and provided herein.
